## 🧠 Long-Term Vision

> “Once situated, I want to be able to simply grab a book, a PDF, or a video/transcript and extract useful content into my site chapters — or into a pool for future integration — and display it all cleanly, even before final curation.”

- Create systems to:
  - Quickly enter, organize, and publish knowledge in phases.
  - Display **unfinished or in-progress pools** of content for preview and future use.
