title: Content Structure & Taxonomy
---

Iâ€™ve touched on this in the [image strategy](/image-strategy), but this document explains the deeper realization behind my current taxonomy and the significance of what Iâ€™m trying to build.

## ðŸ’¡ The Spark: Anchor Tags & Cover Blocks

It started when I realized I was using anchor links and cover blocks in place of proper taxonomy. Initially, I would just embed chapter images, assign tags, and manually link everything. But I began to notice that I wasnâ€™t using WordPress taxonomies to their full extent.

Instead of relying on anchor links to simulate structure, Iâ€™ve now made a system that converts those old patterns into something more powerful and dynamic, using categories, tags, and custom fields.

## ðŸ§± Visual Taxonomy: From Drafts to Blocks

By segmenting chapters into cover blocks and giving each one a home within the tag system, Iâ€™ve turned the tag archive into a kind of dynamic table of contents. Each tag corresponds to a visual hub of related material, which can expand as more chapters are added.

## ðŸ§© ACF and the Future of Custom Tag Pages

This is where [Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) comes in. Iâ€™ve begun replacing the old tag archive pages with custom templates that use ACF fields to define featured content, summary blurbs, and even embedded media. This allows each tag to behave more like a curated hub page rather than a plain list.

## ðŸ§­ Why Structure Matters

Without structure, scaling becomes impossible. The goal here isnâ€™t just to have content â€” itâ€™s to have it organized in a way that is intuitive for users and flexible for expansion. Every tag, category, and relationship is deliberate. This makes automation and maintenance more sustainable going forward.
