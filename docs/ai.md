# 🤖 Using AI in Site Development

AI can be polarizing. The term "AI slop" captures a legitimate concern: low-effort, mass-generated content that clutters platforms like YouTube. We've all seen the AI-generated thumbnails and auto-assembled videos filled with scraped media. While sometimes serviceable, they often lack depth and intention.

But there's a major distinction between **generative AI** (used to churn out content) and **assistive AI** (used to augment and accelerate human creativity and planning). This site uses AI in the latter sense.

## 🖼️ No AI-Generated Images or Writing

* All graphics on this site — especially on tech pages — are **hand-picked**, non-AI assets sourced from platforms like [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/), with AI content explicitly **excluded from search results**.
* I do **not** use AI for generating site text, philosophical analysis, or writing. Everything is authored manually and reflects my thought process.
* **Lyrics** quoted on this site are double-checked:

  * Cross-referenced between multiple sources
  * Audibly verified by listening to the music
  * In some cases, **vocal isolation tools** are used to clarify lyrics — this is one of the few AI tools I use for *assistance*, not generation

## 🛠️ AI as a Development Partner

* I don’t use AI to blindly write or paste code.
* Instead, AI assists with:

  * Planning out workflows
  * Organizing technical concepts
  * Speeding up repetitive or syntax-heavy tasks

This is the difference between being a **programmer** and being a **prompt engineer** — someone who knows what they want to build, and uses AI to reach that goal faster and more efficiently.

## 🧠 Why Not Reinvent the Wheel?

Some developers worry AI is "taking jobs." In reality, **AI eliminates drudgery**. It:

* Helps non-programmers with syntax
* Reduces cognitive load for experienced users
* Turns people with strong technical instincts into **builders** without requiring them to memorize every framework nuance

This echoes the old debate: *Should a hacker write their own OS to be legit?* No. That’s gatekeeping. Tools exist to be used.

## 🚀 A Platform That Couldn’t Exist Without AI

This site went from a simple WordPress blog to a full **dynamic knowledge platform**, thanks in part to AI.

AI has:

* Empowered me to manage servers, themes, image pipelines, and site logic
* Made it possible to build a **semantic, taxonomy-driven database**
* Enabled smarter design, faster debugging, and larger ambitions

## 📚 Toward a Dynamic Knowledge Framework

Soon, I’ll be launching a **fully dynamic content engine**. Using:

* ACF Pro
* Custom taxonomies
* Smart query structures

…I’ll generate intelligent, meaningful pages — not “AI-generated” in the low-effort sense, but dynamically created based on structured relationships between:

* Philosophers
* Artists
* Book passages
* Song lyrics
* Themes and concepts

These aren’t just web pages. They’re interpretive entry points into a larger semantic structure.

For example, I am using ChatGPT to generate these pages, but I am writing them out in full. ChatGPT is simply fixing grammar, structure, and readability based on my contextual history. So instead of it being slop, it is highly accurate — allowing me to spend less time formatting and more time on technical tasks and content creation. In the end, my site is four times further along than it would be without these tools.
