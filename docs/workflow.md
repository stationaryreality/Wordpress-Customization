## 🧰 Tools, Code, and Personal Workflow

Even though I have advanced technical knowledge about computers, networking, and security, I’ve never really focused on programming or database management. These have been my weak spots for decades—but surprisingly, I’ve found this area to be more accessible than I expected. You don’t have to memorize syntax to think like a programmer.

With the help of ChatGPT, I’ve been able to pick up on the concepts behind code organization, system logic, and file structures quickly. The actual writing of code is secondary to understanding how it fits into the bigger system—and that’s something I’ve intuitively understood from years in IT.

## 🛠️ Local Tools

On my local machine, I maintain a very structured folder layout for organizing content, code, backups, drafts, screenshots, notes, and project folders for future integration. I also use Obsidian to manage my thoughts, research trails, TODOs, and notes for future posts.

## 🧑‍💻 Server & Remote Editing

Initially, I managed my server through Terminal on macOS with standard SSH sessions. But since my site evolved, I’ve begun using Visual Studio Code’s remote access to modify and maintain server files more efficiently.

## 🔄 Git & Version Control

All of this is now under version control with Git. I use GitHub for my WordPress customization repo, where I’ve documented my public theme modifications and backend tweaks. This very page is hosted through GitHub Pages.

## ⚙️ WordPress CLI & Database Access

With WP-CLI, I can bypass the WordPress admin interface to export and import data, generate users, update plugins, and manage posts. I’ve also started using more advanced backup and database workflows directly from the terminal.

## 🖼️ Open Source & Media Tools

For content, I rely on open source tools like VLC and ffmpeg for screenshots and video processing. These help me maintain an efficient media pipeline, and I’m planning to write a basic open source tools page to help others understand how powerful these free utilities can be.
