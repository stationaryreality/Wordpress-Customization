# Development Tools & Workflows

Even though I’ve had a strong foundation in IT, networking, and security for years, I never gravitated toward programming or database management. Those areas were known gaps in my skillset, largely because my focus was on low-level systems and theoretical understanding rather than applied code. But as I dove deeper into managing and customizing my own website, I realized that many of these concepts aren't as daunting as they first appeared—especially with tools like ChatGPT available to assist in real-time.

I’ve come further than I expected in just a couple of months. While my WordPress site has been live for about three years, it wasn’t until recently that I fully embraced its potential. What started as a basic setup evolved into a deeply customized environment, driven by a renewed interest in technology and a push beyond basic Linux administration.

## Local Development & Organization

On my local machine, I maintain a highly organized folder structure containing:

- Drafts for posts and pages  
- Web-optimized images and video content  
- Code snippets and site configuration files  
- Notes, ideas, and future integrations  
- Backups and export files  
- Research bookmarks and reading lists  

I use **Obsidian** to manage my writing pipeline and keep track of everything from technical notes to editorial ideas. This keeps me grounded in both short-term tasks and long-term planning.

## Remote Tools & Code Management

For direct server work, I began with the **Mac Terminal** to SSH into my VPS for basic administration (Linux, Apache, WordPress setup, etc.). But now, I primarily use **Visual Studio Code with remote SSH access**, giving me a full development environment connected directly to the server. This allows me to edit templates, tweak my theme, and manage plugin code more efficiently.

I also use:

- **WP-CLI** to handle tasks like exporting and importing content, managing plugins, and performing backups—all from the command line, bypassing WordPress's web interface.
- **Git** for version control of my custom WordPress theme and configuration changes. I maintain a public GitHub repository to document the development process.
- **rclone** and **rsync** to synchronize backups and content with my object storage accounts.

## Media & Asset Workflows

I mentioned in other sections that I use **ffmpeg** and **VLC** to create clean, consistent screenshots from videos. This has been crucial for the visual presentation of posts and chapters, especially when I began incorporating featured images into the grid layout of the homepage.

While these tools are often used by more technical users, they offer massive value even for simple tasks—especially in a workflow centered around open-source principles. I plan to write a dedicated page about my use of open-source tools to help others understand their value beyond just being “free.”

This is the broad overview of how I currently work and evolve my site. As my guides expand into more specific areas, I’ll be able to break these workflows into more detailed, step-by-step pages—with screenshots and walkthroughs drawn directly from my real setup. Those deeper guides will grow naturally out of what’s summarized here.
